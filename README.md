# MWinPriv
Windows console app to display the current privileges of the current access token of the process.  

This application will simply print out all the security priveldges of the access token of the 
current process.  Although the code is simplistic, its intent was to test the C++ class MWinAccessToken
for its use in modifying Windows security privledges.
